1. Scheme (50pt)

	function name: palindrome
	input: 1 list, list1
	output: list1 + inverse of list1

	Example:
	list1 = (a b c)

	output = (a b c c b a)
	  
	Put your source code in a file named pa2scheme1.scm
	and include at lease one test case for your implementation.  
 
2. Scheme (50pt)

	function name: dbl_atm
	input: an atom and a list
	output: a list with all occurrences of the given atom doubled 

	Example:
	atom = a
	list2 = (a (b c a (a d)))

	output = (a a (b c a a (a a d)))
	  
	Put your source code in a file named pa2scheme2.scm
	and include at lease one test case for your implementation.



Deliverables
